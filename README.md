# CS-230-Operating-Platforms
# The client I had worked with was a video game development studio named "The Gaming Room."
# They wanted me to design the software for the game "Draw It or Lose It."
# They wanted the game to be available to play online and across multiple platforms.
# They needed the game to be able to render images simultaneously with other players.
# I was especially proficient at comparing development tools when considering the technical requirements.
# If I had to revise something in the document, I would possibly choose the server side section. After gaining more understanding of how they work, I could update with new information.
# Designing the document was incredibly valuable in laying the groundwork for the code because it allowed me to see the requirements and comparison between operating systems and tools that helped inform the shape of the code. 
# Taking the needs of the client is integral to the design. I recommended operating systems that would be best suited for the server for the game and offered solutions to the requirements of the client. 
# I approached the design of this document and the software it blueprints by understanding the needs of the clinet, researching the options, analyzing the most suitable options and proposing the most suitable options.
